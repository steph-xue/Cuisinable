## Problem Statement:

Dietary restrictions are an issue that many people struggle with on a daily basis. It’s a frustrating and excluding experience, and Cuisinable aims to solve this issue.

Cuisinable is your new personal culinary assistant, empowering individuals with food intolerences to enjoy diverse and delicious cuisines from around the world, safely. With approximately 7% of Canadians self-reporting food allergies—and many more indicating food intolerances—finding recipes that meet specific dietary needs without sacrificing flavour can be a challenge. Cuisinable seeks to solve this problem by offering a welcoming, accessible platform where users can discover tailored recipes based on their dietary restrictions. Simply input your food intolerances and cuisine preferences, and Cuisinable will generate a variety of recipes tailored to your specific needs. 

With a commitment to accessibility and thoughtful design, Cuisinable ensures a seamless experience for users of all abilities. Our friendly mascot, Chef Bearable, greets users on the landing page, setting a warm and approachable tone and guiding them through the recipe-generation process.

Cuisinable is there every step of the way to ensure your recipe can be enjoyed by everyone.

## Cuisinable is built using:
 * Front-end: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
 * Back-end: Node.js and Express.js to manage server requests and API integration.
 * API: The Spoonacular API, which provides a comprehensive database of recipes that Cuisinable filters to match user specifications.

<br>

## Some of the technical challenges and achievements of our project include:
 * Connecting front-end to back-end and establishing seamless communication between the components for smooth functionality.
 * API Data Management: Learning to filter and retrieve specific data from the Spoonacular API to ensure only allergy and intolerance-safe recipes are displayed.
 * Server Configuration: Determining appropriate server ports and navigating Git branches for effective collaboration.
 * Prototyping and designing a user-friendly interface for an intuitive user experience.

<br>
   
##  To enhance the Cuisinable experience, we envision the following:
 * User profiles which allow users to save their dietary preferences and favorite recipes.
 * An expanded recipe database to integrate a larger variety of recipes for more culinary choices.
 * A search function that enables keyword searches for specific dishes or ingredients.
 * Adding animations for a more dynamic and engaging interface.
 * Introducing options for users to invite friends and collaborate on recipe lists for events like potlucks.
